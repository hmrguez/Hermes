The Kappa Architecture, introduced by Jay Kreps, co-founder of Confluent, represents a significant shift from
traditional batch processing architectures towards [[real-time data processing]]. It simplifies the data processing
pipeline by focusing exclusively on processing data in real-time, eliminating the need for separate batch and real-time
processing paths found in [[Lambda Architecture]]. This architecture is centered around the concept of an immutable data
log, where all data—historical and real-time—is ingested and stored in a centralized log, serving as the single source
of truth for continuous processing and analysis of data streams .

### Core Components of Kappa Architecture

- **Immutable Data Log**: At the heart of Kappa Architecture is the idea that all data is treated as an unbounded stream
  of events. This approach ensures that data is continuously available for processing and analysis, regardless of when
  it was generated

- **Stream Ingestion**: Data from various sources is ingested into a stream processing system, such as [[Apache Kafka]].
  Kafka plays a pivotal role in Kappa Architecture by providing a scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructure for
  ingesting, storing, and processing real-time data streams. It ensures the durability and reliability of the ingested
  events

- **Stream Processing**: Once ingested, the data is processed in real-time using stream processing frameworks like
  Apache Flink or [[Apache Spark]] Streaming. These frameworks allow for complex event processing, aggregations, and
  transformations on the streaming data, enabling real-time analytics and decision-making

- **Persistent Storage**: After processing, the events are stored in a fault-tolerant, scalable storage system, such
  as [[Apache Hadoop]] Distributed File System (HDFS), [[Apache Cassandra]] or cloud-based object storage. This storage
  acts as a data lake for long-term storage and potential future batch processing, although the emphasis remains on
  real-time processing

### Advantages of Kappa Architecture

- **Real-time Processing**: Kappa Architecture enables the processing of data in real-time, allowing for immediate
  insights and decision-making. This is crucial for applications that require rapid response to changing data conditions

- **Scalability**: The architecture is highly scalable, capable of handling large volumes of data in real-time. This
  scalability is essential for supporting growing data volumes and increasing user base

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Since Kappa Architecture does not require a separate batch processing layer, it can be more
  cost-effective than [[Lambda Architecture]]. This is because it leverages a single technology stack for both real-time
  and batch processing workloads

- **Simplicity**: The architecture is simpler than [[Lambda Architecture]], removing the complexity associated with
  maintaining separate systems for batch and real-time processing. This simplicity reduces operational overhead and
  increases maintainability

### Use Cases

Kappa Architecture is well-suited for applications that require [[real-time data processing]] and analysis, such as
fraud detection, anomaly detection, monitoring of system logs, continuous data pipelines, real-time data analytics, and
IoT systems. Its ability to process data as soon as it is received makes it ideal for scenarios where immediate action
based on current data is critical

In conclusion, Kappa Architecture offers a streamlined, scalable, and cost-effective solution
for [[real-time data processing]]. By focusing on processing data as streams, it eliminates the complexities associated
with traditional batch and real-time processing architectures, making it an attractive option for modern data-driven
applications.
