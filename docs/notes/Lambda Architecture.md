Lambda Architecture is a data processing framework designed to handle massive volumes of data efficiently by combining
batch processing and real-time stream processing techniques. This hybrid approach aims to address the challenges
associated with processing [[big data]] by providing a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency system capable of
analyzing both historical and real-time data. As it is usual with real time data streaming, input data comes in the form
of [[Apache Kafka]] (generally), due to its fast times and low latency

At its core, Lambda Architecture consists of three primary layers:

1. **Batch Layer**: This layer processes large volumes of historical data in batches. It stores the data in an
   immutable, append-only manner, ensuring a reliable historical record. Technologies like [[Apache Hadoop]] are
   commonly used for data ingestion and storage in this layer.

2. **Speed Layer**: Also known as the real-time or stream processing layer, it handles the processing of new, incoming
   data in near real-time. This layer complements the batch layer by reducing the latency in making data available for
   analysis. Stream processing engines such as [[Apache Storm]], Hazelcast Jet, Apache Flink, and [[Apache Spark]]
   Streaming are often employed here.

3. **Serving Layer**: This layer is responsible for making the processed data accessible for querying. It incrementally
   indexes the latest batch views and the most recent data from the speed layer, allowing users to query both historical
   and real-time data. The serving layer can also reindex data to accommodate changes in requirements or to fix issues.
   Storing is also handled in this layer, most commonly using [[Apache Cassandra]]

The architecture is designed to balance several critical aspects of data processing, including latency, throughput, and
fault tolerance. By leveraging batch processing for comprehensive data analysis and real-time stream processing for
immediate insights, Lambda Architecture enables organizations to respond to data-driven opportunities and challenges
more effectively.

One of the key advantages of Lambda Architecture is its ability to handle high volumes of data across various sources,
making it suitable for applications ranging from ecommerce analytics to banking transactions and beyond. However, it's
worth noting that implementing Lambda Architecture can be complex due to the need for managing separate pipelines and
ensuring synchronization between them.

Overall, Lambda Architecture represents a powerful solution for organizations looking to leverage [[big data]] and
real-time analytics, offering a blend of historical depth and real-time responsiveness that is essential for competitive
advantage in today's data-driven world.
