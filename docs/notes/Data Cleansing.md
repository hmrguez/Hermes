Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing, is a crucial step within the Extraction, Transformation, and
Loading ([[ETL]]) process. It involves identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and anomalies in the source
data before it is loaded into the target data warehouse. This process aims to maintain data quality and integrity,
ensuring that the analytical and reporting functions are reliable and accurate. Data cleaning is essential because it
addresses issues like missing values, misplaced entries, and typographical errors, which are common in "dirty data." By
cleaning data, organizations can enhance the consistency, reliability, and value of their data, leading to more accurate
and insightful analyses and decisions.

Key techniques involved in data cleaning during the [[ETL]] process include:

- **Data Validation**: Checking the data for errors or inconsistencies using various tools.
- **Data Normalization**: Organizing data into a consistent format to ensure compatibility with the data warehouse.
- **Data Filtering**: Removing unwanted data from the dataset to focus on relevant information.
- **Data Mining**: Extracting relevant information from the data using specialized tools.

These techniques can be applied manually or automated using data cleaning tools, which offer efficiency and
effectiveness over manual methods. Additionally, SQL queries can be utilized for data cleaning, particularly for smaller
datasets where a deep understanding of the database structure is beneficial.

Data cleaning is not just about removing errors; it's also about standardizing data formats and ensuring that the data
is complete and accurate before it is loaded into the data warehouse. This process is critical for maintaining the
quality of the data warehouse and supports the overall objectives of data warehousing and business intelligence
initiatives.

In summary, data cleaning is a vital component of the [[ETL]] process, enhancing data quality and integrity, which
ultimately leads to more reliable and accurate analytical outputs and business decisions.
