= Architecture Design

== Solution Proposal

As reflected in the previous section in this work, current architectures for data ingestion, processing and analytics, is generally based on specific use case examples. Choosing between Lambda, Kappa or Microservices architectures depends heavily on the problem at hand and choosing the wrong one may result in latency or performance issues, redundant storage and processing, or even faulty systems.

My goal with this work is to provide a modular approach to data driven architectures. This means a set of components that can be combined in different ways to create a solution that fits the problem at hand. Each module should be removed or added interchangeably and without little effort from the team's side. This way the team can focus on the problem at hand and not on the architecture itself, while also guaranteeing the best performance, scalability and as little redundancy as possible for the system.

I will provide a framework of requirements for each module, as well as a set of possible solutions for each one, providing a hopefully non ambiguous way to describe the architecture and its components.

== Overview

I'll cover the proposed architecture in the following chapters. As mentioned above this so called "Modular" Architecture, is composed in several modules or components, each one facilitating its easiness of use and interchangeability with other components. The main components are:
- Data Ingestion Layer
- Speed Layer
- Batch Layer
- Monitoring Layer
- Storage Layer
- Presentation Layer

However, one would notice that this components feel rather daunting to make the claims that one can change them interchangeably. This is because each component is composed of several sub-components, each one with its own set of requirements and constraints. The following chapters will also cover each component and its sub-components in detail. Splitting the architecture in this way will allow for a more detailed analysis of each component and its requirements, constraints and possible solutions.

== Data Ingestion Layer

The Data Ingestion Layer is the first layer of the architecture. It is responsible for collecting data from different sources and making it available for the rest of the system. This layer is the least complicated because of design so it will be the only one in the entire architecture that will not be split into sub-components.

=== Requirements

To design a robust and efficient Data Ingestion Layer, the following requirements must be considered:

1. *Scalability*: The layer must be able to handle varying volumes of data without degradation in performance.
2. *Fault Tolerance*: The system should be resilient to failures and ensure data is not lost or corrupted during ingestion.
3. *Data Variety*: The layer should support ingestion from multiple sources and formats (e.g., structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data).
4. *Latency*: For real-time data processing, the ingestion layer should minimize latency and support near real-time data flow.
5. *Security*: The system must ensure that the data is secure during transmission and at rest, complying with relevant data protection regulations.
6. *Data Quality*: Mechanisms should be in place to validate and cleanse the data during ingestion. Data must be properly cleansed before going to the next layer, as it is expected to be.
7. *Extensibility*: The architecture should allow easy addition of new data sources without significant rework. Meaning that when adding new data sources you should modify the connector to it, rather than change the schema
8. *Cost Efficiency*: The design should be cost-effective, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing operational costs.

=== Solutions

To meet the above requirements, the following solutions can be implemented in the Data Ingestion Layer:

1. *Scalable Message Brokers*:
    - Use message brokers like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS Kinesis to handle large volumes of data and ensure scalability.
    - These brokers can buffer data during peak loads, ensuring smooth data flow to subsequent layers.

    - Use serverless architectures for on-demand scaling and resource optimization, reducing operational overhead.

== Speed Layer

The speed layer, as it is in other architectures, is responsible for processing, analyzing, filtering, and transforming data in real-time as it comes into the system. This means that latency and performance are the most critical features that this layer has to offer. Since the term "real-time processing" is too ambiguous to refer to as a single component, I have decided to split it into two subcomponents or submodules: Stream Processor and CEP (Complex Event Processing).

Data is already coming in from the Data Ingestion Layer, which serves as a central hub for source connectors and schema translations. This means, as mentioned in the last chapter, that adding a new data source should only mean to modify or add a new connector, it will not require to modify any other underlying code, such as the code in the speed layer.

=== Stream Processor

The Stream Processor is responsible for the continuous processing of data streams, providing real-time analytics, transformations, and aggregations.

==== Requirements

1. *Low Latency*: The Stream Processor must provide minimal processing delay to ensure timely insights.
2. *Scalability*: It must handle high throughput and scale horizontally to accommodate varying data volumes.
3. *Fault Tolerance*: The system must recover gracefully from failures without data loss.
4. *Exactly-Once Processing*: Ensure that data is processed exactly once to maintain data accuracy and removing redundancy.
5. *State Management*: Efficiently manage state information for operations like aggregations and joins.
6. *Interoperability*: Support integration with various data sources and sinks.

2. *Low Latency*: Provide immediate response to detected patterns with minimal delay.
3. *Scalability*: Handle high event rates and scale to support large volumes of data.
4. *Fault Tolerance*: Ensure the reliability and accuracy of event detection even in the presence of failures.

    - Implement temporal windows and sliding windows to manage time-based event patterns.

4. *Stateful Event Processing*:
    - Leverage state management features in CEP engines to handle stateful event patterns.
    - Use persistent storage and checkpointing to ensure state recovery during failures.

5. *Low-Latency Processing*:
    - Optimize CEP engine configurations to minimize processing latency.
    - Use in-memory processing and caching to speed up pattern detection.

By addressing these requirements and constraints with the proposed solutions, both the Stream Processor and CEP sub-components of the Speed Layer can achieve efficient and reliable real-time data processing, enabling timely and accurate insights and decision-making.

Data flow is the following:
1. Data comes into the Stream Processor
2. After processing each piece of data it is sent to the CEP engine
3. If an important pattern is recognized in the stream of data it is sent in the form of a notification to the Monitoring Layer (which I'll discuss later)
4. In any case, processed data is sent to the Storage Layer for further processing or analysis, but data is no longer coming back to the Speed Layer. If you believe fit, then besides from the processed data, there will sometimes be a necessity to store raw data.

It ensures data is stored in a manner that supports fast access, long-term persistence, and efficient querying. This layer is divided into three subcomponents: Fast Storage, Data Warehouse, and Persistent Storage.

=== Fast Storage

When dealing with data it is often necessary to query data more than once in a short period of time, for example an analytics team needing to query a subset of the data any time it needs to create a dashboard or a cluster of end users who all decide they want to see a celebrity's profile picture when their new album is out.

    - Implement support for ad-hoc queries, allowing users to explore data without predefined queries.

5. *Integration with Data Sources*:
    - Connect query engines to data sources in the Storage and Monitoring Layers using JDBC/ODBC connectors or APIs.
    - Ensure seamless data flow and consistency between data sources and query engines.

By addressing these requirements and implementing the proposed solutions, the Presentation Layer can effectively provide data access, visualization, and query capabilities, enabling users to interact with and derive insights from the data stored and processed in the system.
